# 🛍️ StyleMatch AI: Visual-Semantic Fashion Recommender

> **A "Visual Search" engine that recommends clothing based on style similarity, not just text tags.**

## 📖 The Problem: Why "Traditional" isn't enough?

Most traditional recommendation systems (like those used by Amazon or Netflix 10 years ago) rely on **Collaborative Filtering**—analyzing who bought what. While powerful, this approach has a major flaw:

* ❌ **The Cold Start Problem:** If a new shirt is released today, nobody has bought it yet. The system has no data, so it **never recommends it**.
* ❌ **Keyword Limits:** Searching for "Blue Shirt" returns thousands of results, but it doesn't understand *style* (e.g., "Bohemian", "Minimalist", or "Streetwear").

## 💡 The Solution: Visual-Semantic Search

**StyleMatch AI** ignores purchase history. Instead, it uses **Computer Vision** to "see" the product just like a human stylist would.

It encodes the **visual style** (texture, pattern, cut, shape) into a high-dimensional vector space. If you upload a photo of a *floral summer dress*, the AI finds other items with a similar *vibe*, even if they are in different categories or have never been purchased together.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **🧠 Multimodal Intelligence:** Uses OpenAI's **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to bridge the gap between images and meaning.
* **🔍 Vector Similarity Engine:** Performs lightning-fast Nearest Neighbor search using **Cosine Similarity** on 512-dimensional vectors.
* **⚡ Zero-Shot Capability:** Instantly recommends brand-new items without needing any user history.
* **☁️ Edge-Optimized:** Architected to run purely on CPU (via Streamlit Cloud), proving that powerful AI doesn't always need expensive GPUs for inference.

## 📐 System Architecture

The project is built in two distinct phases to ensure scalability and speed:



### Phase 1: Offline Ingestion (The "Brain")
1.  **Ingestion:** We process a dataset of 5,000+ fashion images (H&M Dataset).
2.  **Embedding:** Each image is passed through the **CLIP Vision Encoder**.
3.  **Vectorization:** The model outputs a **512-dimensional embedding** (a list of numbers representing the image's style).
4.  **Indexing:** These vectors are normalized and stored in `.npy` files for ultra-fast retrieval.

### Phase 2: Online Inference (The App)
1.  **User Input:** You upload a photo (e.g., your own shirt).
2.  **Real-Time Encoding:** The app converts your image into a query vector using CLIP.
3.  **Similarity Search:** It calculates the mathematical distance (dot product) between your image and the 5,000 database items.
4.  **Retrieval:** The system returns the Top 5 most visually similar items in < 1 second.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

* **Hybrid Filtering:** Combine this visual engine with user transaction history for higher accuracy.
* **Text-to-Image Search:** Allow users to search by typing (e.g., *"Red dress for a wedding"*) using CLIP's text encoder.
* **Scalability:** Migrate from local files to a Vector Database (Pinecone/Milvus) to handle millions of items.
